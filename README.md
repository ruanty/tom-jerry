# Tom and Jerry Classification
using deep learning to classify Tom &amp; Jerry from images

### ðŸš€ Goal
Find Tom and Jerry in images with Convolutional Neural Network 

### ðŸ—ƒ [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/tom-and-jerry-image-classification?select=ground_truth.csv)
This dataset contains more than 5478 images extracted from some of Tom & Jerry's show videos. Each image is labeled with "Tom only", "Jerry only", "Tom and Jerry", or "No Tom or Jerry". 

### Approach 1:
We built 2 seperate models for Tom and Jerry individually.

### ðŸ“„ TODO List

#### Stage 1. Data Pulling

- [ ] ~~Twitter academic account~~ 
- [x] Implement data fetching function
  - `fetch.py` can only be used to retrieve CSV files, which may not be suitable for MongoDB.
  - `retrieve_tweets_with_details.py` can be used to pull JSON data but requires modification.
- [ ] Implement `Crontab` function

* [fetch.py](https://github.com/summerzhang423/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/fetch.py): Main script for fetching the data.
* [fetch_util.py](https://github.com/summerzhang423/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/fetch_util.py): Implementations of the functions used in `fetch.py`.

### ðŸš€ FAQ for `fetch.py`

#### How to fetch the data?

```bash
$ python fetch.py 
Successful wrote 500 records.
```

#### How to change the parameters for searching?

Modify the values of the following variables in `fetch.py`.

```python
keyword = "btc"
N = 500
isTimeRange = False
# The following time range must be given if `isTimeRange` is set to True
since = None
until = None
```

#### Why there's no `credential_pool` module?

I chose to ignore this script because it is not smart to include secret keys in a public repo. So feel free to ask me for that or create your own `credential_pool` if you need.
